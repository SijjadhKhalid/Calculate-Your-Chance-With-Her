# Calculate-Your-Chance-With-Her
First Coding Project
 
# Description
Visual Basic 
This was my first coding assignment where a formula was used to execute the chances you would have with someone you liked. You would answer a series of questions and the application will calculate what your chances are with the person.

# Functionality
Something similiar to this can be used on dating platforms where formulas can predict best matches.
